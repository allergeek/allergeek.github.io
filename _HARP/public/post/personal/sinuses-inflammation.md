Sinuses are cavities around the nasal passages, lined with mucus-producing membranes. Bacteria growth causes inflammation and increased mucus production and bleeding.

Drinking plenty of water will help to thin the mucus so that it moves more easily.

A nasal wash can remove mucus and germs from the nose and sinuses. Use any saline (saltwater) nose spray or a homemade wash.

Saltwater wash: for 1 cup of cool drinking water, half a teaspoon of soda and half a teaspoon of sea salt

Go for a salt that contains no additives.

can go with less soda

opt. apple cider vinegar - 1-2 drops

opt. essential oils:

eucaliptus OK, oregano OK, very little

Ginger, Pine, Lavender, Tea Trea, Bergamot, Thyme, Chamomile OK

ingeneral, pick antiviral, antimicrobial oils

! oils are for inhalations

very small quantity is OK for washes though

Peppermint, Lemon OK, Rosemary OK, Tea Tree oil seems to be rather effective

might use a large syringe

if burning, re-flush with warm water
