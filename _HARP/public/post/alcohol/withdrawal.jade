h2 Withdrawal

h2 Number 1 is: Drink more water.

h2 Number 1.5: Do not go hungry. Any food is better that none.

h2 Warm liquids, like soups or hot drinks, teas etc., will do good.

h2 Do not pick on sugar and sweet foods. It will slow alcohol metabolism, making the toxicity worse, and will blur the mind.

h2 Bread is OK, it absorbs toxins. Rice is very good, too.

h2 Keep yourself warm, put on some soft, comfortable clothes.

h2 Try to get in bed early, if you can. If you have a chance to fall asleep safely, do so.

p Sorry, this one is not quiet ready yet.
