  <p><b>About Alice</b></p>
  <p><b>The thing is, human memory is limited.</b> Who wouldn't love some extra help here! We carry paper pads in our pockets and backpacks, lined with our daily plans, to-do's and reminder notes. And I do, too.</p>
  <p><b>'Alice, too'</b> is a blog for capturing short notes that may come helpful later. The notes make more sense when they go along with a reference, so I keep quite a few. Hope, you're finding some of them useful. If you'd like to see what comes next, please subscribe
  for updates.</p>
