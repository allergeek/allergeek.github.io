//- + how can I further divide template and content?<br>

//- an array of posts that I want to show in the feed

-
  var titles = [
    "psot title1",
    "psot title",
    "my first post title"
  ]

  var urls = [
    "psot-url-1",
    "psot-url-too",
    "AAWWWWW"
  ]

  var themes = [
    "neuroscience",
    "null"
  ]

| NOW DO THE THEMES IN URLS
| DEAL WITH THE INCULDE VS BLOCK, the jade post content can actually serve its purpose

| When I add a new post preview to the feed,
| I create a var with 3 preview notes in jade, then include this jade file in site index.
| Then I need to replicate a function that generates 3 blocks of heading,
| with the new var name.

include post/neuroscience/psot.jade
include post/neuroscience/my-first-post.jade

//-
  mixin loop
    &thinsp;&thinsp;
    span.tag.tag-title.inline-title= urls[index]
    //span.tag.tag-title.inline-title wrap in a larger loop and try to iterate through the post titles here, or a mixin



- var counter = 0

each note in psot.h2
  a(href= "post/#{urls[counter]}").note-wrapper
    h2= note
      &thinsp;&thinsp;
      span.tag.tag-title.inline-title= titles[counter]

- counter += 1
each note in psot.h2
  a(href= "post/#{urls[counter]}").note-wrapper
    h2= note
      &thinsp;&thinsp;
      span.tag.tag-title.inline-title= titles[counter]

- counter += 1
each note in psottoo.h2
  a(href= "post/#{urls[counter]}").note-wrapper
    h2= note
      &thinsp;&thinsp;
      span.tag.tag-title.inline-title= titles[counter]





//-
  each note in psottoo.h2
    a(href= "post/my-first-post").note-wrapper
      h2= note
        &thinsp;&thinsp;
        span.tag.tag-title.inline-title my first post title

//- to show all notes in one specific post, psot.jade in Neuroscience
//- bag (or var postname) is a variable that became available after including psot.jade
//-
  each item in titles
    each note in bag
      a(href= "post/psot").note-wrapper
        h2= note.h2
          &thinsp;&thinsp;
          span.tag.tag-title.inline-title= item

p Body
p Now I have a list of posts in a single theme, in English only, and they have links to actual post pages.
  | I can also manually include every post in the feed, by copying and formatting its content as a set of objects in the jade file<br>
  | I may pull the themes titles with _current<br>
  | Also, may use a function that creates an array from every line in jade, starting with h2 ?
br

for key, value in public.post.neuroscience._data
  if key.lang == "en"
    a(href=[value])
      = key.title + [' | ' + value]
      br

br
br

p How do I use the list of files that I can get with _CONTENT ?
p may be I could pull the titles into a var from the previous loop
