  <p><b>Alice</b></p>
  <p><b>The thing is, human memory is limited.</b> Who wouldn't love some extra help here! Paper pads in our pockets and backpacks, all the to-do's and reminders. Oh, I carry those, too. When I read, I make notes to recall later.</p>
  <p><b>'Alice, too'</b> is a blog for capturing these short notes. To be able to come back casually and review them. The notes also make more sense when they go along with a reference, a source, so I keep quite a few. Hope, you're finding some of them useful. If you'd like to see what comes next, please subscribe for updates.</p>
