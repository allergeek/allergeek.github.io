  To add a new post preview to the feed, I add a new var with 3 preview notes in feed.jade.
  I add a title to var titles and a url to var urls (to the beginning of each array).
  Then I need to go to index.jade to fix the function.

  Only h2 headings are included there, otherwise empty blocks are created for paragraphs.

  Here's an array of posts that I want to show in the feed, their urls and themes:

-
  var num = 2

  var titles = [
    "psot title1",
    "psot title",
    "my first post title"
  ]

  var urls = [
    "psot-url-1",
    "psot-url-too",
    "AAWWWWW"
  ]

  var themes = [
    "neuroscience",
    "neuroscience",
    "null"
  ]

-
  var psot = {
    h2: [
      "Choose an easy route for your first run. Plan your route around neighborhood streets you're already familiar with.",
      "You don't have to buy running gear to start running. Put on something you feel comfortable in. Pick your favorite hoodie or t-shirt over everything else.",
      "Let's show only 3 or 5 notes from a set."
    ]
  }

  var mews = {
    h2: [
      "mew21",
      "mew22",
      "mew23"
    ]
  }

  var psottoo = {
    h2: [
      "31",
      "32",
      "33"
    ]
  }
