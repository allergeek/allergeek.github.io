  <p><b>About AIice</b></p>
  <p><b>The thing is, human memory is limited.</b> When I read, I write down things that are important for me, or might come useful later. Notes do <b>help me remember</b>.</p>
  <p><b>AIice2</b> is a place for sharing what I've hoarded. Each post usually is a simple list of short notes. It also makes sense to save a reference, a source I'm quoting, so I try to keep a few. That's how my second memory works.</p>
  <p>So, I hope, you're finding it useful, too. If you'd like to see what comes next, <b>please subscribe for updates</b>. <a href="<%- helloStr() %>" class="no-wrap">Send me an email</a> if you need to reach me today.</p>
