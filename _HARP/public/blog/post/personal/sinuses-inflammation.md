Sinuses are cavities around the nasal passages. They are lined with mucus-producing membranes. Bacteria growth causes inflammation, bleeding and increased mucus production.

Drinking plenty of water will help to thin the mucus so that it moves more easily.

A nasal wash can remove mucus and germs from the nose and sinuses. Use any saline (saltwater) nose spray or a homemade wash.

Saltwater wash: for 1 cup of cool drinking water, use half a teaspoon of soda and half a teaspoon of sea salt.

Go for a salt that contains no additives. Also can go with less soda.

Use drinking water or boiled and cooled regular water.

might use a large syringe

if burning, re-flush with warm water

Optional: apple cider vinegar, 1-2 drops

Optional: essential oils

As a general guideline, pick antiviral, antimicrobial oils. Oils are best for inhalations, but very small quantities are OK for washes though.

Eucaliptus OK, Oregano OK - very little amount, Ginger, Pine, Lavender, Tea Trea, Bergamot, Thyme, Chamomile OK, Peppermint, Lemon OK, Rosemary OK, Tea Tree oil seems to be rather effective
